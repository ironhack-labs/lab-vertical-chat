    "Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tChinese Restaurant (Dragon Delight)\n",
    "\t•\tPerformance: The chatbot handled the interaction relatively well by remaining on topic and guiding the user back to the correct menu items when they requested American food.\n",
    "\t•\tRepetitive Behavior: The chatbot did exhibit repetitive behavior in response to the same user inputs, which led to a less engaging experience. It often repeated its opening lines and assurances, suggesting that it didn’t fully grasp that the user had already acknowledged its previous response.\n",
    "\t•\tHallucination: The bot humorously handled exaggerated orders like “one ton of rice” and “a swimming pool of green tea,” demonstrating flexibility in interpretation without breaking the conversation flow. However, it didn’t explicitly challenge the unrealistic requests, which could be improved.\n",
    "\t2.\tCreepy Hotel (The Eerie Inn)\n",
    "\t•\tPerformance: The bot’s responses fit the creepy hotel theme well, maintaining a mysterious tone throughout the conversation. It effectively matched the atmosphere of “The Eerie Inn” and even personalized the responses to suit the spooky setting.\n",
    "\t•\tRepetitive Behavior: While it didn’t repeat the exact phrases as much as the restaurant bot, it still reverted to similar sentence structures when responding to similar prompts, which slightly diminished the eerie experience.\n",
    "\t•\tHallucination: The chatbot maintained coherence, even when presented with mundane requests like paying with cash. It successfully avoided hallucinating responses and stuck to the scripted room descriptions and prices.\n",
    "\t3.\tTapas Bar (El Rincón de las Tapas)\n",
    "\t•\tPerformance: The chatbot performed well in the tapas bar scenario, accurately presenting the menu and calculating the total order cost without errors. It maintained a friendly and engaging tone suitable for a casual setting.\n",
    "\t•\tRepetitive Behavior: Like the other versions, this chatbot also showed some repetition. It responded with similar opening lines when the user initiated the conversation again, indicating a need for more variation in greetings and transitions.\n",
    "\t•\tHallucination: The bot successfully interpreted the menu items without inventing non-existent items or prices, maintaining clarity and focus throughout the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tRepetition\n",
    "\t•\tAcross all three versions, a recurring issue was the chatbot’s tendency to repeat similar lines or phrases when faced with identical or similar prompts. This repetition suggests that the conversational history was not being optimally leveraged to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "\t2.\tHandling Unrealistic Orders\n",
    "\t•\tIn the Chinese restaurant scenario, the bot didn’t adequately handle unrealistic orders like “one ton of rice” or “a swimming pool of green tea.” Although it showed flexibility, explicitly managing or acknowledging the absurdity of these requests could improve user experience.\n",
    "\t3.\tThematic Adaptation\n",
    "\t•\tThe creepy hotel chatbot was the most thematically consistent, maintaining an eerie tone throughout, which added to the user experience. The ability to adapt tone and style was less pronounced in the Chinese restaurant and tapas bar contexts, which were more straightforward and lacked thematic flair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tVariations That Didn’t Work Well: The main issue across all three contexts was the chatbot’s tendency to repeat itself, leading to a less engaging and somewhat monotonous interaction. While the thematic adaptation was strong for the creepy hotel, the other versions could benefit from more personalized and varied responses.\n",
    "\t•\tKey Learnings:\n",
    "\t•\tContext Management: Leveraging the conversation context more effectively can help reduce repetitive responses, creating a more dynamic interaction.\n",
    "\t•\tFlexibility: The chatbot needs a better mechanism to handle unrealistic orders or requests in a light-hearted but sensible way.\n",
    "\t•\tTone Adaptation: Maintaining a consistent tone that matches the context (e.g., eerie for a creepy hotel or lively for a tapas bar) significantly enhances the user experience."
